Description: This package is aimed at social scientists with few programming skills.
    The goal is to provide simple functions for zero-shot and few-shot text annotation,
    as well as (in the future) a few functions that aim to translate ideas from manual
    annotation to automated annotation to allow social scientists to translate existing
    workflows into this new method.
